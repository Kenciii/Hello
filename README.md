# Hello
This was just an exercise to help me learn the basics of git

Here are some basics commands:
- $ cd: change directory
- $ mkdir: make directory
- $ ls: list
- $ git commit: record changes to the repository
- $ git clone: if you want to get a copy of an existing git repository
- $ git status: to determine which files are in which state
- $ git log: viewing the commit history
- $ git push: update remote refs along with associated objects
- $ git commit -am: makes a commit and leaves a message
- $ git pull: fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
- $ git merge: join two or more development histories together
- $ git reset: reset current HEAD to the specified state
- $ git reset --hard <commit>: reset all
- $ git reset --hard origin/master: it returns us to the version that is on github
- $ git branch: it can list the branches you have, create a new branch, delete branches and rename branches
- $ git merge: is used to merge one or more branches into the branch you have checked out
- $ git checkout -b (name): make a new branch
- $ git checkout (name): switch to another branch
- forking project: If you want to contribute to an existing project to which you don’t have push access,
  you can “fork” the project. When you “fork” a project, github will make a copy of the project that is entirely yours
